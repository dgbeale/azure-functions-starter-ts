# Azure Functions - TypeScript Starter

This is a template project that you can you use to instantly code Azure Functions with the online dev environment Gitpod.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an online dev evinroment (based on VSCode) and can launch ready-to-code dev environments for your GitHub or GitLab project with a single click.
It is free for open source projects and is just great to share your running code with the community.


[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#snapshot/ed390d54-0372-4a0e-9dd4-fc13462337e6)

You can Either prefix the URL in the address bar of your browser with https://gitpod.io/#azure-functions-gitpod-node or push the Gitpod button if you have installed the Gitpod [extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).

After you pod has launched I recommend to update the npm packages to the latest version (optional)

```
npm update --save/--save-dev
```

## Getting Started

Add a function
```
npx func new
```
Choose Typescript, select template and enter the name for your func. When you use any other template then 'HttpTrigger' you need to configure the "AzureWebJobsStorage" (see bellow).

Build and start the func host

```
npm run build
npx func start
```

Or just debug with VSCode and the precofigured "Attach to Node Function" launch configuration.


## Configure Function Storage

All binding excepts the HttpTrigger need a configured blob storage. In our Gitpod we can use the [Azurite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azurite) emulator as dev storage.

Install the emulator
```
npm install --save-dev azurite
```

In *local.settings.json* replace {AzureWebJobsStorage} with 
```
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;
```

Start the emulator
```
npx azurite-blob
```

## Deploy to Azure
Use the Azure Functions GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-functions-action) to deploy your function project to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com).


**Happy Func Coding!**
